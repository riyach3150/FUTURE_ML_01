# 📊 Sales & Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning

## 🔗 Project Category
Time-Series Analysis | Regression Modeling | Business Forecasting

## 🔗 Business Scenario
Retail sales forecasting for a retail business using historical monthly data.

## 🔗 Project Objective
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to historical sales data to predict future demand and support data-driven business decision-making.

The model is designed to:
* Forecast future monthly sales
* Analyze sales trends and patterns
* Support inventory and supply planning
* Reduce uncertainty in demand estimation

## 🔗 Dataset Used
The dataset consists of 9,994 historical monthly sales records containing:
  * Date (Time period of sales)
  * Sales (Total revenue for the month)

 Data preprocessing steps included:
  * Date formatting
  * Handling missing values
  * Feature extraction from time variables
  * Trend analysis

## 🔗 Technologies Used
   *  Python
   * Pandas
   * Matplotlib
   * Scikit-learn
   * Google Colab

## 🔗 Model Development
   The forecasting system includes:
   * Regression-based time series modeling
   * Feature engineering
   * Model training and evaluation
   * Performance validation using error metrics

## 🔗 Evaluation Metrics
 The model performance was measured using:
 
   * Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - 12211.03681444415
   * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - 17043.04236436275

 These metrics help assess prediction accuracy and reliability.

## 🔗 Deployment
The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can:
   * Input future time periods
   * Generate sales forecasts
   * Visualize predicted trends

## 🔗 Business Impact
This forecasting system helps businesses:
   * Improve demand planning
   * Optimize stock management
   * Support strategic decision-making
   * Minimize financial risks

## 🔗 Future Enhancements
   * Implement ARIMA / Prophet for comparison
   * Add confidence intervals to predictions
   * Improve UI/UX design
   * Extend to multi-product forecasting
