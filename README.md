📊 SALES & DEMAND FORECASTING USING MACHINE LEARNING

 Time-Series Analysis | Regression Modeling | Business Forecasting


📌 About This Project:-
  This repository showcases my Task 1 submission for the Machine Learning Internship. The project focuses on developing a time-series          regression-based forecasting model to predict future sales for a retail business using historical data.


🚀 Project Demonstration:-
  * Developed a regression-based forecasting model using historical monthly sales data.
  * Performed data cleaning, feature extraction, and trend analysis.
  * Evaluated model performance using standard error metrics.
  * Deployed the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

  The objective of this project was to demonstrate how machine learning can transform historical sales data into actionable business           insights for better planning and decision-making.


🔹 Dataset Description:-

   The dataset consists of historical monthly sales data containing:
   * Date – Time period of recorded sales
   * Sales – Total sales amount for that period
   * The dataset includes 9,994 historical records, which were used to analyze trends and build the forecasting model.
   * This dataset represents a simulated retail business scenario for demand prediction and revenue forecasting.


🔹 Key Features Implemented:-
   * Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
   * Time-Based Feature Engineering
   * Regression Forecasting Model
   * Model Evaluation (MAE & RMSE)
   * Business-Friendly Forecast Visualizations


🔹 Technologies Used:-
   * Python
   * Pandas
   * Matplotlib
   * Scikit-learn
   * Google Colab


⭐ Key Insights from Forecasting Model:-
   * Model trained on historical monthly sales data to capture trend and seasonality patterns.
   * Sales forecast generated for upcoming future periods using regression-based modeling.
   * Model evaluation metrics:
      -->MAE: 12211.03681444415
      -->RMSE: 17043.04236436275
   * Observed consistent upward sales trend over time.
   * Forecast indicates steady demand growth in the upcoming months.
   * Model can assist retail businesses in proactive inventory and revenue planning.


🔹 Business Impact:-

   This forecasting model helps businesses:
   * Predict demand
   * Optimize inventory
   * Improve revenue planning
   * Reduce stock shortages
